Plant pollinator web from Inouye & Pyke (1988) downloaded from IWDB 
(Interaction Web DataBase), 5 June 2018.

The inouye_matrix.txt file was made by copying the in_matr_f.txt file
and changing all nonzero entries to 1 and tab to space (with vi).

The ALAAM outcome binary variable inouye_outcome.txt is random
binary variables generated with the generateInouyePykeALAAMExample.R
script (as are the attribute files). This script also generates
the Pajek format (for use in ALAAMEE) network file inouye_bipartite.net.
The following files were generated by  generateInouyePykeALAAMExample.R:


    inouye_bipartite.net       - network in Pajek format
    inouye_outcome.txt         - outcome binary variable
    inouye_binattr.txt         - continuous attributes
    inouye_catattr.txt         - categorical attributes
    inouye_contattr.txt        - continuous attributes
    inouye.pdf                 - plot of network coloured by outcome variable
    generateInouyePykeALAAMExample.out - stdout of running R script


Some models were estimated with MPNet downloaded from
http://www.melnet.org.au/s/MPNet.exe on 27 August 2022 (saved as
MPNet_MelNet_20220827.exe on SWITCHdrive), now as per Peng's fix get
correctly 1 not 2 for count of C4X-1B for bipartite tiny example,
giving the following files:

  inouye_alaam_mpnet.clu
  inouye_alaam_mpnet.pnet
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_ALAAM.clu
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_ALAAM_est.txt
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_Network_M_0.txt
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_Network_X_0.txt
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_model.txt
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_update.txt
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_Network_M_VPNet_Nodes_0.txt
  inouye_alaam_mpnet_Network_M_VPNet_Edges_0.txt
  


Note that ActivityXA was found to be significant in an MPNet converged
model (and also sometimes by the ALAAMEE bipartite example using the
same data) - but this is actually an example of a false positive, in
that since the outcome variable was actually randomly generated, this
"statistically significant" effect is spurious.

	General information
	This paper reports a community-level study of the pollination biology of alpine plants in Kosciusko National Park in the Snowy Mountains of south-eastern New South Wales, Australia. The flora and their associated insect pollinators were observed from December 1983 until March 1984.

	Data type
	The authors recorded their data by counting the number of individual flower visitors caught on each plant species. The total number of individuals collected on each plant species provide a rough estimate of the level of visitation that each species received. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.
