r"""Functions to compute change statistics for ALAAM. Each function
takes a Graph G and outcome vector A and returns the change statistic
for changing outcome of node i to 1.

The attribute statistics take also as their first parameter the name of 
the attribute to use, used as the key in the relevant attribute dictionary
in the Graph object. So that these functions have the same signature as
the structural statistics, use functools.partial() to create a function
with the (G, A, i) signature, e.g. partial(changeo_Oc, "age").
Similarly for the use of the setting network (another fixed graph for
different relationships than the main graph G) the setting-homophily
change statistic is used as e.g. partial(changeSettingHomophily, Gsetting).
The same technique is used for the geometrically weighted statistics
e.g. partial(changeGWActivity, math.log(2))

Most of the change statistics here are documented in Daraganova & Robins
(2013) Tables 9.1-9.3 (pp. 110-112) and the PNet manual Appendix B
"IPNet Graph Statistics" (pp. 42-43), and here I use a similar naming
convention to the latter. Similarly, the diagrams will follow a
similar convention where a black or solid node, shown as an asterisk
"*" here, denotes an actor with the outcome attribute, while a hollow
or white node, shown as an lowercase "o" here, denotes an actor with
or without the attribute.

    This is an ALAAM analogue of the geometrically weighted degree
    statistic defined by Equation (11) in:

    Snijders, T. A., Pattison, P. E., Robins, G. L., & Handcock,
    M. S. (2006). New specifications for exponential random graph
    models. Sociological methodology, 36(1), 99-153.

    See also Section 3 (pp. 219-222) in:

    Hunter, D. R. (2007). Curved exponential family models for social
    networks. Social networks, 29(2), 216-230.

    and the Remark on p. 222 of Hunter (2007) relating the GWD
    statistic defined there to that defined in Snijders et al. (2006),
    and both papers for the relationships between gwdegree and the
    alternating k-star statistic.

    alpha > 0 is the decay parameter controlling the geometric rate of
    decrease in the weights. For large alpha, the contribution of
    positive outcomes on higher degree nodes is decreased. As alpha goes
    to 0, increasing weight is placed on outcome vectors with positive
    outcome on high degree nodes.  See Sjniders et a. (2006) p. 112.

    Note lambda_s = exp(alpha)/(exp(alpha)-1) [p. 113 Snjders et al. 2006]
    and 1/lambda_s = exp(-theta_s) = 1 - exp(-alpha) [p. 222 Hunter 2007]
    theta_s = -log(1/lambda_s)
    alpha = -log(1 - 1/lambda_s)
    So for the "traditional" value of lambda = 2 we have
    alpha = -log(1 - 1/2) = -log(1/2) = log(2) =appox 0.69


    The purpose of this statistic is to try to avoid problems with
    near-degeneracy when using the Activity, Two-Star, Three-Star,
    etc. parameters, by instead using this parameter to model
    alternating k-stars or alternatively as in this parameterization,
    geometrically weighted degree distribution.

    Note that the change statistic for ERGM (described in those
    papers) is not the change statistic here for ALAAM. In ERGM,
    modeling the network (stars or degree distribution here) the
    change statistic is for adding an edge, and so involves counting
    the additional number of stars created by adding an extra edge.
    However for ALAAM, the network is fixed, and the change statistic
    is for switching the outcome of node i from 0 to 1, and hence the
    number of stars (or activity degree) at the node is 0 before the
    the switch, and hence the change statistic is just related to the
    number of stars at the node i. And hence this is just the
    contribution of the single term for i in Equation (11) of Snijders
    et al. (2007), which is a sum over all nodes.

    This is like GWActivity, but with the outcome on all the Alter
    nodes as well as Ego. The idea is to use this rather than
    Contagion to test for Alters and Ego both having outcome, but with
    geometic decay to help prevent near-degeneracy problems, just as
    GWActivity does when used instead of Activity (and TwoStar, etc.)

    Note that this statistic may not actually be useful (in particular
    difficult or impossible to interpret its corresponding parameter)
    as this change statistic can be negative or positive, depending
    on the number of neighbour nodes of i with the outcome variable,
    and the number of neighbour nodes of those neigbbours with the outcome

    the value of the GWContagion parameter,
    then it can be increasing, or decreasing, depending on the network.

    beta > 0 specifies the power 1/beta that the contagion statisic
    is raised to.

    This is based on the idea from Wilson et al. (2017) described
    in Blackburn & Handockc (2022) of raising network statistics
    to a positive power less than one. So e.g. would hvae beta = 2
    for square root.

    than more elegant implementation using list comprehensions.
